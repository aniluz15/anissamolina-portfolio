                  One of my favorite places to go is Durango Colorado where I visit my bestfriend and his family. I
                  travel solo and stay during the winter. It is genuinely my favorite place to go. It is absolutely
                  gorgeous there.

    Traveling
    One of my favorite places to go is Durango Colorado where I visit my best friend and his family. I travel solo and
    stay during the winter. It is genuinely my favorite place to go. It is absolutely gorgeous there.
    Another one of my favorite places to visit is the beach! Whether it is Pismo Beach, Monterey or the beach in San
    Francisco I always really enjoy going with family and friends.
    My favorite beach has to be the Waikiki beach in Honolulu Hawaii. It is so relaxing and calm and the water and ocean
    life is absolutely beautiful.

Even despite our differences we all love each other. While 2 have moved away to two different states they still occasionally come back to visit and those are some of the best days of the year!</div>

My parents gave me their old Toshiba laptop to play mini-games on when I was a toddler and my love for games grew from there. I have played on many different consoles and hand-helds including DS-Lite, Wii, Nintenso Switch, XBOX, and Playstation. I enjoy playing shooter games as well as calming and relaxing games.</div>

          Work experience
           
          My first job I worked as a Cyber Security technician for a start-up company but my most recent experience is my experience interning for Harris Ranch through my User Experience Design class. This experience has been the most meaningful to me as I have gotten to apply the concepts learned in my UX Design class in real-life work. For this internship, I collaborated with a team to create a 3 fold brochure using design concepts we learned in Figma. I also became a project lead to research what amenities that Harris Ranch could offer to guests using primary and secondary research as well as conducting a competitive audit. I currently work as a Crew Member at Panera Bread while in school.
