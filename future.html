        <p style=" width: 50%;font-size: x-large;">Throughout high school, I never really struggled with not knowing what I wanted to do. During my sophomore year, I took AP Computer Science Principles and realized I genuinely enjoyed coding and computer science.
    
            The next year, I went to the Center for Advanced Research and Technology and took User Experience Design. This class allowed me to gain an understanding of design principles necessary to be able to properly design websites in an accessible manner.
            This year, I have taken the Web Applications Development lab at CART and have genuinely enjoyed it. While I enjoyed my time in UX. Design, I realized that I enjoyed my Web class much more. The work is something I enjoy much more and I feel a lot more challenged which I enjoy.
            
        
        I am nervous for the future as I don't know what it will bring. However CART has more than prepared me for my future in so many ways by teaching us the habits of mind. </p>
